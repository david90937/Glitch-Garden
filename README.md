This is the last 2D game developed during the Udemy course. After I completed the course-guided work, I added a new feature, an additional level or two, and some new enemies. 

As with the previous projects, some of the code in the scripts is my original solution to a problem that was presented during the course; periodically (frequently), the instructors would pause the lesson and challenge us to apply what we have just learned to accomplish a task. In the cases where my original solution worked just as well as the one provided by the instructors, I left my original in tact. 

I added three new enemies, two of which were just color changes of existing enemies provided during the course, and one was a collection of basic animation frames downloaded from a free source. I animated the last one in the animator to my liking, and changed the paramaters (stats) of all enemies to my specifications. 

The new feature I added was a bare bones leveling and stat system; I only added one stat, but the foundation is there to add additional ones. I added an experience value to each enemy that would be awarded upon death, a (very) basic level bar that would fill up as experience was gotten, and stat points that would be awarded upon level up; these could be spent by the user on the stat they wished to increase.
